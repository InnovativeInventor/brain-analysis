Week of Mar 28th
1. Our goal for the week was to get feedback on our project proposal and properly respond - we are currently in the process of reworking our proposal.
2. We all worked on the proposal - there were no other specific tasks we accomplished, and we all worked on the proposal.
3. Our initial proposal was rejected, so we couldn't start working on the actual codebase as soon as we would've liked.
4. We hope to submit an approved proposal next week, so that we can start working on the codebase.
