Week of Mar 28th
1. Our goal for the week was to get feedback on our project proposal and properly respond - we are currently in the process of reworking our proposal.
2. We all worked on the proposal - there were no other specific tasks we accomplished, and we all worked on the proposal.
3. Our initial proposal was rejected, so we couldn't start working on the actual codebase as soon as we would've liked.
4. We hope to submit an approved proposal next week, so that we can start working on the codebase.

Week of Apr 4th
1. Our goals for the week were to rework our proposal into something that fit the CS225 project description more closely. We've made good progress on formulating an idea, and are currently rewriting our proposal.
2. Since we are still workshopping our idea, everyone contributed significantly in brainstorming and refinining our current idea.
3. We initially sought to adapt the Lisp interpreter idea to a graph project - this didn't work very well, so we had to come up with a new idea from scratch.
4. We hope to have our proposal submitted by early next week, and have some code up and running so that we can begin to work with our data.

Week of Apr 11th
1. Our goals for the week were to submit our proposal and start working on reading in our data into a C++ graph representation. We've successfully submitted our proposal and have loaded brain fMRI voxel data into an adjacency list in C++.
2. Zhenan and Ling put in a lot of work in defining what the problem we'll be tackling looks like. We all contributed to create our project proposal. Zhenan created a series of shell / python scripts to pre-process our data into a simple text form. Russel has created an initial adjacency list representation in C++ and code for reading in our data into a graph.
3. The data took more pre-processing than we realized, so that delayed our progress by ~1 day. Other than that, we didn't run into any issues.
4. We will implement at least one of our algorithms in the coming week, and we hope to be able to interpret the results of applying that algorithm on our data.
