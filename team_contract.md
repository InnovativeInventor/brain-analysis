# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 6-7 PM using Zoom or getting together in-person. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with zhenans2. During the meeting, we will discuss the overall progress of the project, and any urgent issues / items to complete. We will also discuss items for the weekly development log during this time.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

3. **Respect** One group member will serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak, or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, the tasks will be sequentially given to the member with the current least amount of work. These are not hard-and-fast rules; adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work on the project for a reasonable amount of time. However, we will be understanding to each other if a member cannot put as much time in the project in a given week. We are willing to step in for each other on a short-term scale to ensure long-term success and to minimize stress for each member. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be decided by a group meeting, resolved by a vote.
